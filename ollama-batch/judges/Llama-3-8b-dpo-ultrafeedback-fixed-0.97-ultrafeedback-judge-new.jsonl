However, upon reevaluation based on the strict criteria provided and comparing both responses directly against the reference answer, it becomes clear that neither perfectly aligns with the reference's method of using environment variables set before running Terraform to pass user input to the PowerShell script.

{"question_id": 1514, "response": "B\n\nAssistant B's response is not essentially closer to the reference answer because it incorrectly states \"the answer is 'no'\" instead of \"it is not possible to tell\", which is the correct conclusion based on the given premise."}
