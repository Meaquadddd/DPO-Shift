{"question_id": 13, "category": null, "turns": ["Here is a piece of text: Sending a rover to Mars is cool\u2014but sending one to Mars along with a helicopter is even better. Yes, that is the plan for the next NASA Mars rover, scheduled for 2020. The idea is to have a driving rover that brings along a small coaxial helicopter. The helicopter will be self-powered and fly for a few minutes a day. The main advantage of the helicopter is that it can scout ahead of the rover and take pictures and stuff\u2014maybe some epic rover selfies. But really, it should be a huge advantage over previous rovers.\nBesides being a cool Mars mission, this Mars helicopter is also perfect for some physics questions. Here are some questions and answers regarding this flying robot.\nWhy doesn't it have a tail rotor?\nThe Mars helicopter is not your traditional helicopter. For a helicopter with a single rotor (like the ones you usually see on Earth), the tail rotor is required to counteract the change in angular momentum (and the frictional torque from the air) due to the main rotor spinning. Without the tail rotor, the helicopter would spin out of control and crash\u2014or at least get the passengers very dizzy. A coaxial helicopter has two counter rotating blades. Since the two rotors are spinning in opposite directions, the total angular momentum is zero and there is no need for torque from an extra tail rotor.\nGetting rid of the tail rotor also does something else\u2014it saves space. You can make a smaller helicopter by using a coaxial rotor. Smaller is better\u2014especially with the limited space on board the rover. Getting a bigger helicopter on the rover would be like trying to fit an overstuffed rolling suitcase in the overhead bin on your last cross-country flight. Also, I should point out that the Mars helicopter doesn't go back to the rover, but it does start there.\nWill a helicopter work on Mars?\nWith regards to helicopter flight, there are two big differences between Earth and Mars. First, the density of the atmosphere on Mars is significantly lower than on Earth (only about 1 percent of our atmospheric density). Second, the gravitational field is also lower on Mars (just 38 percent of the gravity on the surface of the Earth). The lower atmospheric density makes it more difficult to fly a helicopter, but the lower gravity makes it easier.\nThe real question\u2014how do helicopters fly? In a very basic model of helicopter thrust, the rotors take air above the helicopter and throw this air down. Since the \"thrown\" air has an increase in momentum, this requires a force\u2014which is the lift force. Also, we can imagine this mass of air is in the shape of a cylinder with the radius of this air-cylinder the same as the area of the helicopter rotors.\nThe momentum of the downward thrown \"air\" (I'm going to use air for the stuff on Mars and Earth) depends on the speed that it's moving down and the mass. But what about this mass of air? Since the thrust force depends on the rate of change of momentum, I don't actually need to know the height of this cylinder of air.However, the rate of change of air-mass does indeed depend on the size of the rotors and the density of air. From that, I can get the following rough approximation for the thrust force from a helicopter.\nYou can probably guess that the A is the rotor area and v is the speed the air is pushed down. The density of air is represented by the Greek letter \u03c1. But what about gravity? Well, if the helicopter is to hover then the thrust force must be equal to the weight. We can calculate the weight as the product of mass (m) and gravitational field (g).\nSince the air density on Mars is just 0.01 that of on Earth but the gravitational field is 0.38 as much, the lower gravity benefit does not match the loss in air density. It's more difficult to hover on Mars than on Earth. Oh, please notice that this is just a rough model for the thrust force from a helicopter. Please do not use this calculation to attempt to build your own human-carrying helicopter. However, you could use it to calculate the correct size of the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier rotors.\nActually, here is a quick homework question for you. Based on the known mass and size of the Mars helicopter, what is the air speed from the rotors in order to make this thing hover?\nWhat about the flight time?\nNASA says that the Mars helicopter will be able to fly for about two to three minutes per day. The rest of the time, it will use its solar panel on the top of the vehicle to recharge the battery. So, how big of a battery does this thing need? There are actually two ways to estimate the battery size (other than asking NASA\u2014that's the boring way).\nThe first method considers the charging time. Basically, this thing will recharge for a whole day. On Mars, each day is almost exactly the same as an Earth day (but 37 minutes longer). But the total day doesn't matter\u2014what matters is the length of sunlight time. Just like on Earth, the length of daylight on Mars changes with the seasons. So, let's just estimate that the sun is visible of 10 hours a day (I just picked that for fun).\nThe next thing to determine is to think about the solar irradiance. This is the power per unit area that the is in the light reaching the surface of the planet. For Earth, this has a maximum of about 1,000 Watts per square meter. On Mars, it's only about 2590 Watts/m2\u2014but remember that is the maximum. Over the course of a day, the sun appears to change position. If you have a static facing solar panel, the average irradiance will be smaller. I'm just going to go with 295 Watt/m2. Since the size of the solar panel appears to be approximately the size of the cube part of the robot, I will estimate its radius (it looks circular) at 7 cm. With this size, irradiance, length of a day, and an efficiency of 25 percent, that would give a total energy of about 40,000 Joules. That's very close to the energy stored in the battery of the iPhone X\u2014note, there are some tricks going from units of mAh to Joules.\nNow for the second method. How much power would it take for the Mars helicopter to fly for three minutes? How do you calculate flying power? Well, think of it this way. Power is the rate at which you use energy. What is the helicopter doing with its energy? It is taking air above it and increasing its speed (an increase in kinetic energy). I'm skipping some steps, but from that I can get an expression for the power needed to hover\u2014you can find all the details in my calculation of the power needed for a human propelled helicopter (yes, that's a real thing).\nTo calculate the flying power, I need to know the rotor size (14 cm diameter) and the helicopter mass (about 1 kg). From this, I can calculate the thrust air speed needed to hover. And with the speed, I can calculate the rate of change of air kinetic energy\u2014which is the power. With these values (along with the density of air and the gravitational field on Mars), I get a flying power of 374 Watts (note: here are my calculations in python).\nBut wait. NASA has already released the power requirement for the helicopter at 220 Watts. Personally, I consider this to be close enough for a win-win. Win for me for doing this and win for you because you read it.\nIf I go with the NASA power of 220 Watts I can calculate the energy required to run for three minutes since power = energy/time (don't forget to convert the time to seconds). This gives a power usage of 3.96 x 104 Joules. Boom. Right around the energy value for the other calculation.\nI probably should have left this whole thing as a homework problem\u2014but I couldn't help myself. I wanted to see if the numbers worked out.\nWelcome to the Aerodrome, where engineers are simulating wind conditions to teach drones to fly safely.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Using the material provided, can you calculate the air speed required for the Mars helicopter to hover?"]}

Michael Davis, indefatigable defender of the TLM is buried in the churchyard. It is a beautiful church, but the parish is very small, and doesn't have much of an income.\nIf any of my readers would be willing to help, it would be greatly appreciated - and it would help so many in their experience of this wonderful Sacrament. There is a button for online donations (as well as the address for cheques) on the donations page of the parish website.\nMiaowrini is very much an outdoors sort of cat. She is also one of the clumsiest I have ever seen. As a kitten, she jumped up on the toilet on the one occasion when I had left the lid up, and fell in. She also fell in the swing-bin when attempting to jump over it. And she has fallen in the bath when I was filling it.\nIt was only a matter of time before she did some damage to herself. On Sunday night she appeared to have major difficulty walking, and growled when I attempted to examine her back legs. Despite the difficulty, she seemed to be ok when lying quietly, and happily munched through her dinner when I brought the bowl over to her, so I decided to keep her in the bathroom and assess the situation in the morning.\nShe was still unable to weight-bear on the left back leg in the morning, but since she had slept quietly during the night, I decided to leave her in the bathroom until after work. The minute my last lesson had finished, I headed straight home to collect the cat for a visit to the vet.\nMiaowrini lived up to her name, miaowing plaintively as I took her out in the cat carrier, though she calmed down once she was in the car. I'd phoned earlier in the day to make the appointment with the vet, so we didn't have to wait too long.\nThe vet seemed a little puzzled, and called in a colleague for a second opinion. Miaowrini's knee was very swollen and she had a high temperature, which suggested an infection of some sort, and there was no obvious sign of a fracture (my original fear) but the leg was too swollen to be sure. Apparently there is a slight possibility that she had damaged the top surface of the tibia in some sort of fall, but the vets didn't want to rush to give her an anaesthetic for x-rays, and decided that it was better to give her a painkiller and anti-inflammatory and a course of antibiotics. The other possibility is that she's had a run-in with another cat or a fox.\nIn the meantime, I was to keep her inside and monitor her. If she didn't show any sign of improvement, or got worse overnight, I was to bring her back as an emergency, but otherwise the vet would try and carry out an examination on Friday when the swelling had gone down.\nThis morning Miaowrini seemed a little more active, though still unable to weight-bear. I was heartened by the fact that she made a break for it when I opened the bathroom door, but it was pitiful to see that she just couldn't manage more than a quick hobble. I was going to keep her in the bathroom for another day, but it occurred to me that, if the pain was less, she might try and jump up on the bath or other slippery surfaces, and I didn't want her to make things worse, or fall.\nAs a result, I moved all her things into a corner of the sitting-room.

Example\nCONTEXT: The balance of power had shifted considerably since the first set of quotes. King Joffrey is dead, and his younger brother Tommen is now king. Unlike his wild card of an elder brother, Tommen is gentler and more prone to manipulation by his new bride. The Lannisters impeccable image has also been shattered. They failed to prevent the assassination of their king in the midst of his own wedding day, and the suspected assassin is the king's Lannister uncle. Not only do they look incompetent, they are divided among themselves. On the other hand, the Tyrells' situation is much stronger now. Tommen is already wrapped around Margaery's pretty little finger, and she knows that the assassination was orchestrated in part by her own family. In Margaery's eyes, the Lannisters look disoriented and lost. Putting on a show trial for one of their own, whom she knows is innocent of any wrongdoing.

Question: What happens when Pete tries to warn Suzanne? Title: Blood Feast Movie plot: In the midst of a series of gruesome murders, a young woman is killed inside her suburban Miami house by a grey-haired, wild-eyed man. He stabs her in the eye and hacks her leg off with a machete, bagging the leg before he leaves. At the police station the next day, detective Pete Thornton investigates the killing, noting that it is the latest in a series of four murders by a homicidal maniac who has yet to leave any clues. The police chief advises him to continue to pursue the case. At Fuad Ramses Catering store, wealthy socialite Dorothy Fremont arrives, where she arranges for Fuad to cater a party for her daughter Suzette.

Thornton arrives on the scene with the police chief. After failing to obtain any useful information from the distraught Tony, they interrogate Marcy's mother, who can only tell Pete that her daughter belonged to a book club. Staking out a local motel, Fuad sees a drunken sailor drop his wife off at her room. Fuad knocks on the woman's door and attacks her when she opens it. Fuad rips the woman's tongue out through her throat as another ingredient to his \"blood feast\".

Answer according to: NOTE: This item comes in a GREY Color, not available in Black. Note: Can only use up to 8x9\" designs on Brother PR machines, unless you are splitting designs on your embroidery software or Brother's PE Design software first. Double height, 24cm x 24cm (9\u2033\u00d79\u2033) square frame. Fits Brother PR600/Baby Lock Series machines. Common uses: Children\u2019s clothing, larger square designs that round hoops cannot accommodate. This hoop fits the Brother PR600, PR-600C, PR600II, PR620, PR650, PR1000, and the PR1000e and the Baby Lock EMP6, BMP8, BMP9 and ENT10 embroidery machines. The hoop carries a LIFETIME WARRANTY on the plastic components and feature Durkee\u2019s exclusive EZ TURN Thumbscrew. Ships with the brackets attached. Grids not available. *To embroider a design of 5 x 7\" you must allow for the design itself, as well as, the sewing head. The next size up for that from Durkee would be our 9\u201d x 9\u201d hoop. As long as that size hoop will fit into the project you are embroidering, that would be your best bet from Durkee. It also happens to be the most popular hoop size we sell to the home embroidery market. It is our pleasure to detail the guarantee provided for our tubular hoop line. We guarantee the plastic component of the round hoops for a lifetime against manufacturer's defects. We will exchange the plastic component at no cost provided the breakage is not due to abuse or using the parts in a manner not consistent with commercial embroidery practices. The Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square is great for embroidering children\u2019s clothing and larger square designs that round hoops cannot accommodate.This Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square is constructed of high impact plastic making it virtually indestructible. The Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square has brass inserts for all screws, light texture on the hooping surface, directional guides, and extra height, which aids in holding thicker, harder to hold garments. The adjusting rings' thumb screws on the Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square are large and long to provide more torque and have a wider space for adjustments. The metal clips on the Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square are extra long, aiding in vibration reduction. The Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square metal clips are zinc plated to provide reduced wear, and they come complete with plastic screws and lock washers. Thumb screw is larger and longer than our competitors'. Wide space thumb screw adjusting. For optimum design registration, it is important to use a hoop that is closest to the size of the design. This will help eliminate puckering as well as wasting other supplies, such as backing or topping. Very efficient and the website worked out great for me! The hoop is wonderful. It allows for a larger size design than a 5x7 on a kid shirt. the only problem is that the threads strip after a while leaving the hoop unusable. I love the hoop though so I am about to order my 4th one. Will order again from your site! The price was right. I'll be shopping here again. Love you guys... just you have so many items that sometimes it is hard to find what I am looking for. I purchased this hoop in 2011 and recently wanted to use it for an 8\" x 8\". The hoop is not large enough as the corners are too rounded and the hoop will not accommodate a square design. The wrong Durkee hoop was sent but Delores was wonderful and took care of the problem to my complete satisfaction. Will definitely order from All Brands again! I will order from Allbrands before any other internet business when possible because of the friendly, prompt response to all orders and the best prices on nearly all items. Very rarely do I find an item priced cheaper, but I still order from Allbrands because of the very prompt filling of orders. Shipment was fast, price was good. Love the hoop."]}

{"question_id": 466, "category": null, "turns": ["Q:Information:  - The Elenium is a series of fantasy novels by David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes:  - David Eddings (July 7, 1931  June 2, 2009) was an American fantasy writer. With his wife Leigh, he authored several best-selling epic fantasy novel series, including \"The Belgariad\" (198284), \"The Malloreon\" (198791), \"The Elenium\" (198991), \"The Tamuli\" (199294) and \"The Dreamers\" (200306).  - Genre (or ; from French \"genre\" , \"kind\" or \"sort\", from Latin \"genus\" (stem \"gener-\"), Greek , \"g\u00e9s\")   - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \"literary\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - The Tamuli is a series of fantasy novels by David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes:  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \"superntrlis\": \"supra\" \"above\" + \"naturalis\" \"natural\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \"speculative literature\".  - The Malloreon is a five-part fantasy book series written by David Eddings, which follows \"The Belgariad\". The Malloreon is set in the same world as The Belgariad, but expands on several aspects of the setting, especially the eastern continent of Mallorea.  - The Belgariad is a five - book fantasy epic written by David Eddings , following the picaresque journey of protagonist ' Garion ' and his companions , first to recover a sacred stone , and later to use it against antagonist ' Kal Torak ' .  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \"literature of ideas.\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.

Article: Peter Jackson, currently one of the world's most well-known directors and the unofficial face of the entire nation of New Zealand, was born on October 31, 1961 in Pukerua Bay, New Zealand. He liked to take photographs, so a family friend bought the young   Jackson a super 8mm camera. He has been a filmmaker even since. At age nine he even attempted to remake his favorite film, King Kong, using his own stop-motion effect. Unlike many of the filmmakers working today, Jackson never went to film school. Instead he created his own short films with the help of family and friends. He was turned down for a job at the National Film Unit, New Zealand's government agency that produces tourist films about the country. With that avenue closed, Jackson began working other jobs to support himself, while shooting shorts on the weekend. One of these weekend films, expanded from its original ten minutes length into a feature film. The project took four years to complete (1983-1987)and was called Bad Taste. After the success of Bad Taste, Jackson became recognized as a director and the door to fame and fortune was opened. He gave up his job at a local photographer's shop and became a well-known director of horror-movies. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is obviously a huge  landmark in Jackson's career, not only did the films become some of the most commercially successful of all time,  _ His digital effects company, WETA Digital, became one of, if not the most respected effects company in the world; similarly, Jackson has also expressed an interest in returning to his roots and directing some lower-budget splatter films again.

The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story. And a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. To sum up, you should write the second sentence of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the new ending(last three sentences) of the story.\nOne example is below.\nQ: Premise: Brad stole the ball from the opponent. \n Initial Context: While he was running with the ball, he noticed his friend. \n Original Ending: He threw the ball in the air, near the hoop.

If the monthly subscription is $14, but I pay only 50% that means I pay every month $14 * 50% = $7. We know that in 1 year there are 12 months. Therefore if each month I pay $7, in 12 months I'd pay $7 * 12 = $84. The answer is 84.\n[Question]A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18, and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%. Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?\n[Answer]The six T - shirts cost 6 x $8 = $48. The four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $72. And five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $400. So, a discount of 10 / 100 x $400 = $40 for the five jackets. Thus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $360. Hence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $480. The sales tax is equal to 5 / 100 x $480 = $24. Therefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $504. including the sales tax.

It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets.\nExample output: is house tax and property tax are same\nExample explanation: The question generated asks whether the house tax and property tax are the same and can be answered by reading the passage. Additionally, it has a binary answer and hence the generated question is correct.\nQ: Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure -- Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is a 1989 American science fiction comedy film directed by Stephen Herek and written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon.

The unemployment rate, for example, was\nunchanged at 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low. And the labor force participation rate rose to 63.2 percent, from 63\npercent, suggesting that workers who had been on the sidelines are gradually being lured back into the labor\nmarket.\nThe proportion of Americans between the prime working ages of 25 and 54 who were employed hit 80 percent in\nAugust, the best showing in the current expansion.\n\u201cOur labor market is in quite a strong position,\u201d the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H.

Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action \"sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub\". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would \"have a leg to stand on\" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be \"on the table\" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was \"absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation.\" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said \"legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade\". \"Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,\" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. \"They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power.\" Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or 'concordat' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: \"I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. \"The argument we'll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it's not the reality of intergovernmental relations.\" \"The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. \"At the moment, your answers aren't giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government's argument is, 'we'll see you in court', it's not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together,\" he added. Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: \"Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? \"Absolutely not... and it's not just in relation to trade, it's in relation to almost every aspect of government policy.

In the field of clinical data, transformers have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis and decision-making[Searle].\n\nSignificant benefits Transformers language models have, comparing traditional models, include:\n\n- \\*\\*Increased amount of data\\*\\*: Transformers can process large volumes of clinical data and retain context, resulting in improved prediction accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models. Self-attention mechanism enables a better understanding of the relationships between data, allowing for accurate predictions even with a large amount of data[Vaswani].\n- \\*\\*Increased speed:\\*\\* Transformer language models have faster training time than RNNs if you can access sufficient computing because of the paralysation method. Decreases recurrence in favour of drawing global relationships between input and output.\n- \\*\\*Increased accuracy:\\*\\* Transformer language models have been shown to outperform traditional language models in terms of accuracy.\n- \\*\\*Increased flexibility:\\*\\* Transformers are more flexible, allowing for the use of different types of data (e.g., images and text) and tasks (e.g., classification and generation).\n- \\*\\*Increased interpretability\\*\\*: They are easier to interpret, making it easier to comprehend how the model works and what it has learned.\n- \\*\\*Increased efficiency\\*\\*: They are more efficient, requiring less training data and computational resources.

The solution should use Go code and a table of specific negative words to accomplish this task.

Passage: The group was occasionally diverted from strategic missions to carry out air support and interdiction missions. It supported Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy by attacking transportation targets, including bridges, along with airfields and strong points in France. On D Day, the squadron and the rest of the 446th Group led the first heavy bomber mission of the day. The 446th aided ground forces at Caen and Saint-L\u00f4 during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. During Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen. It struck lines of communications during the Battle of the Bulge. During Operation Varsity in March 1945, it supplied ground and airborne troops near Wesel. The squadron flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945 against Salzburg, Austria. The group had flown 273 missions and had lost 58 aircraft during the war,\n.\nA: During Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen.\nRationale: The passage describes the 704th's actions during Operation Market Garden.\nQ: Question: When was the subject of White Lies born? Passage:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences.

To do so, the authors first propose a metric to measure the mutual substitutability of sense inventories with human judgments for the lexsub task, and empirically measure the substitutability of inventories from various sources such as WordNet and PPDB. Next, they propose clustering different paraphrases of a word from PPDB using a multi-view clustering approach, to automatically generate a sense inventory instead of using the aforementioned inventories. Finally, they use these clusters with a naive (majority in top 5) WSD technique to filter existing ranked list of substitution candidates.  - Strengths:  * The key idea of marrying vector space model based approaches and sense inventories for the lexsub task is useful since these two techniques seem to have complementary information, especially since the vector space models are typically unaware of sense and polysemy.  * The oracle evaluation is interesting as it gives a clear indication of how much gain can one expect in the best case, and while there is still a large gap between the oracle and actual scores, we can still argue for the usefulness of the proposed approach due to the large difference between the unfiltered GAP and the oracle GAP.  - Weaknesses:  * I don't understand effectiveness of the multi-view clustering approach. Almost all across the board, the paraphrase similarity view does significantly better than other views and their combination. What, then, do we learn about the usefulness of the other views? There is one empirical example of how the different views help in clustering paraphrases of the word 'slip', but there is no further analysis about how the different clustering techniques differ, except on the task directly. Without a more detailed analysis of differences and similarities between these views, it is hard to draw solid conclusions about the different views.                                    * The paper is not fully clear on a first read. Specifically, it is not immediately clear how the sections connect to each other, reading more like disjoint pieces of work. For instance, I did not understand the connections between section 2.1 and section 4.3, so adding forward/backward pointer references to sections should be useful in clearing up things. Relatedly, the multi-view clustering section (3.1) needs editing, since the subsections seem to be out of order, and citations seem to be missing (lines 392 and 393).  * The relatively poor performance on nouns makes me uneasy. While I can expect TWSI to do really well due to its nature, the fact that the oracle GAP for PPDBClus is higher than most clustering approaches is disconcerting, and I would like to understand the gap better. This also directly contradicts the claim that the clustering approach is generalizable to all parts of speech (124-126), since the performance clearly isn't uniform.  - General Discussion:  The paper is mostly straightforward in terms of techniques used and experiments. Even then, the authors show clear gains on the lexsub task by their two-pronged approach, with potentially more to be gained by using stronger WSD algorithms.  Some additional questions for the authors :  * Lines 221-222 : Why do you add hypernyms/hyponyms? * Lines 367-368 : Why does X^{P} need to be symmetric? * Lines 387-389 : The weighting scheme seems kind of arbitrary. Was this indeed arbitrary or is this a principled choice? * Is the high performance of SubstClus^{P} ascribable to the fact that the number of clusters was tuned based on this view? Would tuning the number of clusters based on other matrices affect the results and the conclusions? * What other related tasks could this approach possibly generalize to? Or is it only specific to lexsub?\nanswer:\nen\n\n\nquestion:\nInteresante propuesta en un ambiente de desarrollo de software que es bastante pobre en aspectos metodol\u00f3gicos de desarrollo.

Do not answer with words other than the two options, and do not answer with option titles(e.g. \"option1\" or \"1\" are not acceptable answers.)\n\nExample input: Passage: Omelettes make a great breakfast , and I enjoy making them because they are very easy to cook . First , I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl . I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories . I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor . I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan . I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I do n't want them to stick . As this occurs , I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture . Really , almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette . I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle . It is then ready to serve ! Question: Where is the omelette being browned? Option1: In the pan Option2: On the street\nExample output: In the pan\nExample explanation: As mentioned in the passage that I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan; it is clear that omelette is being browned in pan only. Also, there is nothing related to street mention in the passage.\nQ: Passage: Last week I posted my first movie review . My friends and I went out to see the movie \" Sorry to bother you \" . We did n't like the movie very much , so afterwards I felt compelled to post a movie review . After doing some research about where I should post something like a movie review where others can read it , I settled on the idea of posting the movie review to a website called Rotten Tomatoes . After I 'd done that , I was given the opportunity write about why I decided to give the movie the score that I did . Afterwards , I spell checked my review and read it through once more . I had my friends read my review to see what they thought of it , and then I decided to publish my review on Rotten Tomatoes . Overall , it was fun to write my own movie review , and I 'll likely be doing more in the future . Question: What was the person asked to assign a score for? Option1: future Option2: movie\nA:"]}

I pick up. \u201cHello, you are speaking to the marketing agency Mueller and Partner, my name is Jens K\u00fcgler. What can I do for you?\u201d. That\u2019s what it sounded like: the phrase that we employees didn\u2019t just have to learn by heart, but had to repeat every time the phone rang. Word by word. Our boss forced us to do so! You can imagine how annoyed regular callers were and interrupted us already with the third word with \u201cyes yes \u2026 this is Mike \u2026 \u201c.\nLong phrases are no longer in demand, as the entrepeneurs\u2019 magazine unternehmer.de recently wrote. The callers want to speak immediately and tell their concerns. Our attention belongs to them! What else did the authors write? All a matter of course, actually. Nothing new, but worth to go into it again.\nSmile on the phone\u2014that\u2019s important. When telephone marketing and call centres came up in the 1980s, employees looked into a mirror when they were on the phone. A smile automatically improves the mood and encourages a more positive choice of words. The conversation partner notices this even without video and webcam!\nSpeaking of attention: Active listening is the magic formula. The conversation partner does not want to be interrupted. He wants to know that his message is getting through. Therefore it is helpful to take notes about his most important statements and to repeat them in the conversation. This does not only reveal attention. It helps to prevent the most important things from being forgotten. And it shows that you are interested.\nDo you have to cope with bad news? A statement like \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t give you the order this time\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t approve your holiday application\u201d? Sure: The result can be frustration or sadness. Rarely, however, this is the intention of the caller. On the contrary: Often he himself is in a stressful situation and only the bearer of the bad news. Here communication professionals recommend: \u201cRedirect\u201d feelings. Simply clench a fist, noiselessly hit the pillow, crumple a piece of paper \u2026 and open a frustration valve. This way you can regain control more quickly and continue to speak in a normal tone of voice.\nLast but not least: As an active caller you have advantages if you plan your conversation instead of conducting it spontaneously. Determine what your goal is: to conclude a business deal? Get to important information? Take your time, create a conversation guide right the way that call center agents use it\u2014with statements on customer benefits and objections! If you want to sell something: Ask the called person questions, which he can only answer with \u201cyes\u201d like \u201cYou surely know the problem that your PC crashes when you have to transfer large amounts of data?\u201d.\nSounds like a worn-out telemarketing strategy? That\u2019s right. The aggressive cold acquisitions with mass calls should be a thing of the past. It annoys the customers. And, according to current data protection guidelines, it can only be used to a limited extent. But in situations where you, as a salesperson, have concrete discussions with interested parties, these guidelines are still very helpful!"]}
